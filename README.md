Hi, I’m STV.
A developer in training focused on practical software projects and cybersecurity exploration. I build tools that solve real problems while studying penetration testing and secure coding. My work reflects a journey of continuous improvement—clean, functional, and learning-driven. Open to collaboration and meaningful tech conversations.
